# Website publishing contract

The repository owns the setup content. The Voiceflow website publishes it.
There is no second hand-maintained setup guide and no runtime dependency on a
private GitHub fetch.

## Build and consume

Run `python3 scripts/build.py` from a clean, approved commit. The generated
`dist/site/agents/` directory contains:

- `setup.md`: the canonical guide, with local Markdown links rewritten for web use.
- The guide routes by available capabilities; chat assistants read individual
  Markdown files without downloading the plugin archive. CLI and hosted MCP
  procedures are linked references in the same versioned payload.
- `voiceflow/`: the complete plugin and all linked skills, references, and installers.
- `voiceflow.zip`: the same plugin in a reproducible archive.
- `manifest.json`: version, source commit, dirty status, per-file hashes, and a
  content digest. The archive hash is `files["voiceflow.zip"]`.

Copy that directory into the website's static public directory as `agents/`.
The intended canonical address is `https://www.voiceflow.com/agents/setup.md`.
This repository prepares that payload; it does not deploy or claim that URL is
live. Deployment belongs to a later website change.

Serve Markdown as UTF-8 text/markdown, JSON as application/json, and ZIP as
application/zip. Avoid login walls, HTML wrappers, or client-side rendering.
Preserve relative paths. Do not serve a human documentation template at the raw
Markdown URL.

Deploy the entire directory atomically. Use revalidation for the canonical
setup guide and manifest; retain immutable snapshots under a versioned path
if the website supports them. Do not update a manifest before its archive.

## Website integration gate

1. Consume an approved commit's CI artifact, not an unreviewed branch or latest
   moving release. Reject `hasUncommittedChanges: true`.
2. Validate every file hash and confirm the manifest's sourceCommit is the
   intended approved revision. The manifest is provenance, not a signature.
3. Deploy all files together and fetch the public setup, linked skill, manifest,
   and archive from a fresh unauthenticated session.
4. Test the one-prompt journey in each supported coding and chat client and a new
   conversation. Verify chat hosts can fetch linked Markdown and connect remote
   MCP; do not treat offline fixtures as live client compatibility evidence.
5. Only then update the CTA's copied prompt to:
   “Set up Voiceflow by following https://www.voiceflow.com/agents/setup.md”.
6. Keep the previous bundle for an atomic rollback. A rollback does not
   automatically downgrade plugins already installed by customers.

Before public publication, replace preview-branch acquisition language in the
canonical guide with the stable public source. The rest of the install and
verification flow remains shared.
